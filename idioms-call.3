.SH "NAME"
idioms\-call \- print command to standard error, run it, die if it exits successfully
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\f(CR. \fBidioms\fP\fP
.sp
\fBcall\fP [\fB\-kn\fP] \fICOMMAND\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBcall\fP prints the \fICOMMAND\fP given to standard error, formatted like so:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
+ _COMMAND_
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
and then executes it. If the command exits unsuccessfully, it will die (using idioms\-die(3)),
reporting the command that failed and the code it exited with.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
Any options passed \fBmust\fP be given before the \fICOMMAND\fP. Anything after a "\fB\-\-\fP", or the first
argument that does not begin with a dash will be considered to be where the \fICOMMAND\fP begins.
.sp
\fB\-k\fP
.RS 4
Keep going if \fICOMMAND\fP fails, do not die. This will raise a warning (using idioms\-warn(3)) if
\fICOMMAND\fP exits unsuccessfully.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-n\fP
.RS 4
Don\(cqt actually run \fICOMMAND\fP, just print it. You may also set \fI_idioms_call_dry_run\fP to do
the same.
