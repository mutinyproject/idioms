= idioms(7)

== Name

idioms - overview of idiomatic utilities for scripting

== Description

*idioms* is a set of useful utilities designed to make scripting more idiomatic, and make shell
usage perhaps so too. It's akin to `moreutils`, but the main goal is to standardize common tasks,
improve code quality and quality of life.

*idioms* consists of these utilities:

*idioms*(1)::   functions
*match*(1)::    check that a string matches a pattern

== Dependencies

.Build
* make(1)
* sed(1)

.Runtime
* A POSIX-compliant shell. (ex. bash(1), dash(1), mksh(1), busybox `ash`, etc.)
    ** An implementation of the POSIX-defined `printf` command. This might be provided by the shell
       but it can also just be a regular command without issue. 
* A POSIX-compliant `grep`.

.Development
* https://github.com/shellspec/shellspec[`shellspec`], if you wish to run tests.
* shellcheck(1), if you wish to lint files.
* asciidoctor(1), if you wish to regenerate manual pages.
