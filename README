NAME
       idioms - overview of idiomatic utilities for scripting

DESCRIPTION
       idioms is a set of useful utilities designed to make scripting more
       idiomatic, and make shell usage perhaps so too. It’s akin to moreutils,
       but the main goal is to standardize common tasks, improve code quality
       and quality of life.

       idioms consists of these utilities:

       idioms(1)
           functions

       match(1)
           check that a string matches a pattern

DEPENDENCIES
       Build

       •   make(1)

       •   sed(1)

       Runtime

       •   A POSIX-compliant shell. (ex. bash(1), dash(1), mksh(1), busybox
           ash, etc.)

           •   An implementation of the POSIX-defined printf command. This
               might be provided by the shell but it can also just be a
               regular command without issue.

       •   A POSIX-compliant grep.

       Development

       •   shellspec <https://github.com/shellspec/shellspec>, if you wish to
           run tests.

       •   shellcheck(1), if you wish to lint files.

       •   asciidoctor(1), if you wish to regenerate manual pages (HTML, or
           manpage format).
