NAME
       idioms - overview of idiomatic utilities for scripting

DESCRIPTION
       idioms is a set of useful utilities and functions designed to make
       scripting more idiomatic.  It’s akin to moreutils, but the main goal is
       to standardize common tasks, improve code smell, and also make
       automating things like safely failing when running commands easier.

       idioms consists of these parts:

       backslash(1)
           combine lines that end with a backslash

       idioms(1)
           setup usage of idioms(3) functions in a script

       idioms(3)
           useful functions that work within a script runtime

       integer(1)
           check if all given arguments are positve integers

       lastarg(1)
           print the last argument given

       match(1)
           succeed if all strings match a given pattern

       ratelimit(1)
           limit how often a command can be ran

DEPENDENCIES
       Build

       •   make(1)

       Runtime

       •   A POSIX-compliant shell. (ex. bash(1), dash(1), mksh(1), busybox
           ash, etc.)

           •   An implementation of the POSIX-defined printf command. This
               might be provided by the shell but it can also just be a
               regular command without issue.

       •   If you wish to use the color functionality, you need a tput(1)
           command, likely provided by ncurses
           <https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/> or NetBSD’s curses
           <https://github.com/sabotage-linux/netbsd-curses>.

       •   For match(1): A POSIX-compliant grep.

       Development

       •   shellspec <https://github.com/shellspec/shellspec>, if you wish to
           run tests.

       •   shellcheck(1) <https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck>, if you wish
           to lint files.

       •   asciidoctor(1) <https://asciidoctor.org>, if you wish to regenerate
           manual pages (HTML, or manpage format).
