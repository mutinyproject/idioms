= ratelimit(1)

== Name

ratelimit - limit how often a command can be ran

== Synopsis

*ratelimit* [*-e* _ENTROPY_] _TIME_ _COMMAND_...

== Description

*ratelimit* creates a lock file, runs _COMMAND_ as a child, waits the _TIME_ given to elapse, and
then removes the lock file. _TIME_ is simply passed to sleep(1), so it supports whatever format
sleep(1) uses.

If, during the wait period, *ratelimit* is ran again with the same arguments, it will not run the
command and will instead exit 100.

The lock file is a sum (generated with cksum(1)) of any *-e* arguments given, and the _COMMAND_.

== Options

*-e* _ENTROPY_::
    Add _ENTROPY_ to the list of strings used to calculate the name of the lock file; this function
    is useful for running multiple rate-limited instances of a command and preventing them from
    clashing.
