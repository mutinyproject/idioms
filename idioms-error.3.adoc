= idioms-error(3)

== Name

idioms-error - print an error message to standard error

== Synopsis

`. *idioms*`

*error* _MESSAGE_...

== Description

*error* prints each _MESSAGE_ to standard error, formatted like so:

    *error*: _MESSAGE_

and then returns successfully.

So as to keep the amount of flow control functions to a minimum, you are expected to run
idioms-die(3) afterwards if you wish for the program to die after showing the error.

If colors are enabled (see idioms(3)), then "error" will be red and emboldened.
