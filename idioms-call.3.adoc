= idioms-call(3)

== Name

idioms-call - print command to standard error, run it, die if it exits successfully

== Synopsis

`. *idioms*`

*call* [*-kn*] _COMMAND_

== Description

*call* prints the _COMMAND_ given to standard error, formatted like so:

    + _COMMAND_

and then executes it. If the command exits unsuccessfully, it will die (using idioms-die(3)),
reporting the command that failed and the code it exited with.

== Options

Any options passed *must* be given before the _COMMAND_. Anything after a "*--*", or the first
argument that does not begin with a dash will be considered to be where the _COMMAND_ begins.

*-k*::
    Keep going if _COMMAND_ fails, do not die. This will raise a warning (using idioms-warn(3)) if
    _COMMAND_ exits unsuccessfully.

*-n*::
    Don't actually run _COMMAND_, just print it. You may also set __idioms_call_dry_run_ to do
    the same.
