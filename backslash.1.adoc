= backslash(1)

== Name

backslash - combine lines that end with a backslash

== Synopsis

*backslash* [_FILE_]

== Description

*backslash* combines lines that end up with a backslash. It takes no options, and merely calls out
to sed(1) to actually do the work.

For example, if *backslash* were given as input:

[example]
----
foo bar baz \
quux quuz xyzzy\
zzy
----

it would output:

[example]
----
foo bar baz quux quuz xyzzyzzy
----

== Notes

It would be a plain ol' sed(1) script, but that would cause options to be passed to sed(1), which
from a presentation standpoint just looks silly.
