= `idioms`

A set of useful utilities designed to make scripting more idiomatic, and make shell usage perhaps
so too. Sorta like `moreutils` but the goal is to standardize common tasks more than anything.

== Requirements

* A POSIX-compliant shell. (ex. `bash`, `mksh`, etc.)
	** An implementation of the POSIX-defined `printf` command. This might be provided by the shell
	   (it is in `bash`), but it can also just be a regular command without issue.
* A POSIX-compliant `grep`.
* https://github.com/shellspec/shellspec[`shellspec`], if you wish to run tests.
